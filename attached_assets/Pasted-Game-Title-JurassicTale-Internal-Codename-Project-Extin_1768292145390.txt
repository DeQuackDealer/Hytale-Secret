Game Title
JurassicTale
(Internal Codename: Project Extinction)
High Concept / One-Liner
JurassicTale is a Hytale-based fantasy adventure survival MMO where players build and defend compounds in a dinosaur-filled Exclusion Zone, balancing exploration, progression, and high-stakes storm events.
Elevator Pitch
JurassicTale is a persistent multiplayer open-world experience built on Hytale. Players begin at a safe research compound hub and venture into the Exclusion Zone—an expansive wilderness filled with dinosaurs, ruins, rival outposts, and unpredictable dangers. Players can establish their own compounds, expand infrastructure through tiered power cores, hire NPCs for security and operations, trade and form partnerships, and face optional high-stakes PvPvE “Chaos Windows” that enable raids and world instability. The game emphasizes discovery and player-driven stories while avoiding high-barrier survival complexity.

Design Pillars
Adventure-First

 The world should feel exciting, magical, and cinematic—not grindy or punishing.


Compounds Are the Spine

 A player’s compound is their identity, progression path, and strategic advantage.


Simple to Learn, Deep to Master

 New players can build quickly; advanced players optimize zones, defenses, and operations.


Danger is Optional but Meaningful

 PvP and raids primarily occur during Chaos Windows—risk is high but predictable.


Anti-Monopoly by Design

 Large operations become harder to manage through NPC payroll pressures and sabotage risk.


World Integrity Matters

 The Exclusion Zone stays visually pristine via building limitations outside compounds and/or erosion/reset mechanics.


Key Differentiators
Tiered power core progression (Field → Industrial → Nuclear → Fusion)


Wireless Power Grid + Zones system (easy onboarding, strategic depth)


Dinosaurs can threaten weak structures (prevents “dirt hut meta”)


Chaos Storm Events introduce PvPvE raids, instability, and cinematic moments


NPC payroll + scaling sabotage creates natural balance against server domination


Temporary camps for long-range expeditions + dangerous nights for immersion
