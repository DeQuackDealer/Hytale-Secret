1) Dino Design Pillars (Rules we follow)
Every dinosaur should:
have a role (not just a skin)


be tied to a territory/biome


have a behavior pattern players can learn


create choices (risk/reward, preparation, tools, travel)


support either: hunting, fear, capture, economy, or events



2) Dino Categories (the main roster structure)
A) Herbivores (Herd Wildlife)
Purpose:
world feels alive


primary food/material source


“safe-ish” targets


stampede hazards


Examples:
small: quick prey


medium: herd defense


large: tanky & valuable



B) Pack Predators
Purpose:
create fear + teamwork requirement


punish careless travel


night danger synergy


Behaviors:
flanking


bait response


chase + retreat loops



C) Apex Predators
Purpose:
territory boss vibes


high rewards


forces compound defenses to matter


Behaviors:
long patrol routes


roar “zone warning”


aggro through weak structures (break blocks)



D) Flyers
Purpose:
air danger


disrupt camps / convoys


create vertical threats



E) Aquatic / Swamp Threats
Purpose:
makes water travel dangerous


supports swamp territory identity



F) Cave / Underground Threats
Purpose:
stop underground safety exploit


protect mining loop



G) Legendary / Event Dinos
Purpose:
server hype


chaos storm content


guild-level goals



3) Territories & Dino Zones (how the world stays readable)
Each region should advertise what lives there:
Grasslands / Valley = early herbivores + small predators


Dense Jungle = pack predators + rare dinos


Swamp = aquatic ambush dinos


Highlands / Cliffs = flyers


Caves = underground threats


Storm-Scarred Zone = apex + event spawns


This lets players plan expeditions instead of wandering randomly.

4) Behavior Systems (core mechanics)
Instead of designing 40 dinos fully, we design 6–8 shared behavior templates:
Herd AI (flee, defend young, stampede)


Ambush predator AI (wait, burst attack, retreat)


Pack AI (surround + coordinate)


Territorial AI (patrol + roar warning)


Scavenger AI (attracted to corpses/campfires)


Cave hunter AI (sound/torch attraction)


Storm frenzy AI (Chaos Windows aggression buff)



5) Capture System Tie-In (high level)
Every dino should have:
Temperament


Passive / Skittish / Aggressive / Territorial / Apex


Capture Difficulty


Easy / Medium / Hard / Extreme


Transport Class


Small / Medium / Large / Massive


This matters more than crafting right now.
