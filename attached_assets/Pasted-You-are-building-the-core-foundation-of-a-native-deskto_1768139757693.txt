You are building the core foundation of a native desktop launcher and optimisation platform called Yellow Tale, alongside a server-side ecosystem called Rubidium.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:

You DO NOT have access to hytaleserver.jar

You MUST NOT assume any Hytale-specific APIs

You MUST NOT build a website or web-based UI

This is NOT a frontend-heavy project

The goal is to build everything possible BEFORE server internals exist, while cleanly stubbing future integrations.

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Primary language: Rust (preferred for performance and safety)

Optional secondary language: Java (ONLY for future server integration)

UI: native desktop (Tauri, egui, or equivalent lightweight native UI)

Architecture: modular, service-based

CORE PRINCIPLES

Performance-first

Server-authoritative design

Strict ToS safety

Feature flags for all advanced systems

Clean separation between:

launcher

optimiser

hosting tools

cosmetics

IMPLEMENT NOW (FULL IMPLEMENTATION)

Implement the following systems fully, without assuming any game internals:

CPU core affinity manager

Adaptive process priority controller

Memory pressure optimiser

Disk IO asset cache with deduplication

Asset and shader pre-warming system

Frame-time stability monitor

Background process suppression

Hardware-aware optimisation presets

Local world hosting wrapper

NAT detection and hosting advisor

Save snapshot and rollback system

Mod dependency resolver

Generic asset CDN fetcher

Content profile manager

Cosmetic preview engine

Local-only cosmetic injection layer (singleplayer only, auto-disabled in multiplayer)

FUTURE SYSTEMS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT — TODO ONLY)

Create clear interfaces, documentation, and TODO stubs for:

Server-side tick optimisation

Network packet batching

Rubidium cosmetic authority

Dynamic server load shedding

These must be placed in a /todo or /future module with:

interface definitions

comments explaining required server hooks

no implementation logic

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Clean project structure

Extensive inline documentation

Clear separation of concerns

Configuration via local files (not remote)

No hardcoded game logic

This codebase must be future-proof, legal, and ready to integrate server internals once available.

Begin by scaffolding the full project, then implement each module incrementally.
