Use this to define scope, not to implement monetization logic yet.

📌 CONTEXT

You are working on Yellow Tale (launcher) and Pond (server-side system).
Some features are free, others are premium-tier, but all features must be architected cleanly so premium functionality can be enabled or disabled later without rewrites.

Do NOT implement payments.
Only design feature gates.

⭐ POND — PREMIUM FEATURES (ARCHITECTURAL ONLY)
Server Performance

Advanced tick scheduling

Adaptive entity throttling

Dynamic chunk activation

Memory pooling & reuse

Server load prediction

Live Server Tooling

Runtime plugin hot-loading

Live configuration reloads

Real-time performance dashboards

Safe plugin sandboxing

Cosmetics & Identity

Server-approved cosmetic registry

Temporary cosmetic overrides

Creator cosmetic support

Asset validation & scope control

Server ↔ Launcher Integration

Advertise supported features to Yellow Tale

Accept launcher-provided asset manifests

Validate cosmetic ownership

🧠 IMPORTANT

All premium features must:

be optional

fail gracefully

not block core gameplay

not introduce pay-to-win mechanics

🟡 PROMPT 2 — REPLIT AI ULTRA PROMPT: POND CORE BASE

Paste this separately into Replit AI.

🔧 PROJECT: Pond — Server-Side Modular System

You are an expert server systems engineer.

You are building Pond, a server-side modular platform designed to run alongside a moddable sandbox game.

This system must be:

high performance

modular

hot-reloadable

stable under load

legally safe

game-agnostic

🚫 HARD RULES

DO NOT assume any game-specific APIs

DO NOT inject into clients

DO NOT require client-side mods

DO NOT patch binaries

DO NOT depend on Yellow Tale to function

Pond must work independently, but be integratable later.

🧱 TECH STACK

Language: Java (preferred) or Rust

Config: TOML or YAML

Logging: Structured logs

Architecture: Plugin-based, modular

⚙️ CORE SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT
1️⃣ Server Lifecycle

Start / stop / reload

Graceful shutdown

Crash recovery hooks

2️⃣ Plugin System

Plugin discovery

Load / enable / disable at runtime

Dependency resolution

Version compatibility checks

Fault isolation (plugin failure ≠ server crash)

3️⃣ Scheduler & Performance Core

Tick loop abstraction

Task prioritization

Adaptive throttling

Entity & system budgeting

Performance metrics exposure

4️⃣ Asset & Cosmetic System (Server-Side)

Cosmetic registry

Asset metadata validation

Scope control (session / server / event)

Temporary availability

Server approval rules

⚠️ Do NOT implement rendering or client hooks
Only manage availability & rules

5️⃣ Yellow Tale Integration (Abstract)

Optional integration module

Read-only server capability export

Accept asset manifests from launcher

Validate cosmetic ownership

Zero hard dependency

6️⃣ Configuration System

Versioned configs

Live reload support

Safe fallback defaults

7️⃣ Telemetry & Observability

Tick cost metrics

Memory usage

Plugin performance stats

Structured logging

🧪 ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS

Clear plugin lifecycle contracts

Defensive programming

Extensive documentation

No hardcoded limits

Designed for story & gameplay plugins

🎯 DELIVERABLES

Compiling core system

Working plugin loader

Example plugin

Clean documentation

🧠 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Pond is:

Paper-like in spirit

Story-friendly

Performance-first

Extensible without rewrites

If a feature compromises:

stability

legality

long-term maintainability

DO NOT implement it.
