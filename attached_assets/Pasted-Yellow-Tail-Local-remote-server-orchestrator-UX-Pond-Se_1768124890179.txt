Yellow Tail = Local & remote server orchestrator + UX
Pond = Server enhancement layer + plugin substrate
Hytale Server = Black box (for now)

Your goal before release is to build everything around the box, not inside it.

🧱 LAYER 1 — CORE FOUNDATIONS (100% PRE-JAR SAFE)

These are non-negotiable, and none require Hytale internals.

1️⃣ Filesystem & Workspace Layout

Design this NOW.

yellow-tail/
 ├─ profiles/
 ├─ servers/
 │   ├─ local/
 │   ├─ remote/
 ├─ pond/
 │   ├─ core/
 │   ├─ plugins/
 │   ├─ assets/
 ├─ cache/
 │   ├─ assets/
 │   ├─ mods/
 ├─ logs/


Features:

Profile isolation

Atomic updates

Rollbacks

Disk quotas

Cleanup policies

2️⃣ Profile System (User-Facing)

Before any server exists.

Create/edit/delete profiles

Clone profiles

Import/export profiles

Version pinning

Performance presets

Mod packs per profile

💡 Profiles should be pure data, no engine assumptions.

3️⃣ Configuration Engine

Shared by Pond + Yellow Tail.

TOML/YAML/JSON schema

Validation

Hot reload support

Defaults + overrides

Per-profile overrides

Per-world overrides

This becomes your spine.

⚙️ LAYER 2 — PROCESS & SERVER ORCHESTRATION

Still no Hytale needed.

4️⃣ Server Lifecycle Manager

Yellow Tail owns this.

Start/stop/restart servers

Watchdog (crash recovery)

Graceful shutdown

Timeout detection

Resource caps

Works for:

Local SP servers

LAN servers

Dedicated servers

5️⃣ Java Process Supervisor

Critical for Pond later.

JVM flags generator

GC tuning presets

Heap monitoring

Thread usage metrics

Crash log capture

Even without Hytale, this is fully buildable.

6️⃣ Logging & Telemetry Pipeline

Design once, reuse forever.

Unified logging format

Log levels

Rotating logs

Structured logs (JSON)

Metrics hooks (CPU, RAM, tick time)

Later:

Pond feeds into this

Yellow Tail visualizes it

🧩 LAYER 3 — POND CORE (NO HYTALE API REQUIRED)

This is HUGE and totally safe.

7️⃣ Pond Plugin System (Abstract)

Do not tie it to Hytale yet.

Plugin loader

Plugin lifecycle:

load

enable

disable

unload

Dependency resolution

Version constraints

Sandboxing rules

Failure isolation

You’re building a meta-plugin system that later wraps Hytale’s.

8️⃣ Pond Internal Event Bus

Design your own event model now.

Server lifecycle events

Plugin events

Asset events

Performance events

Custom events

Later → you bridge Hytale events into this.

9️⃣ Performance Optimization Layer (Abstract)

This is key.

You’re not optimizing Hytale yet — you’re optimizing server behavior patterns.

Tick scheduling model

Async task pool

Rate limiting

Backpressure system

Memory pressure signals

Plugin CPU budgets

Later → Pond maps these to real server hooks.

🎨 LAYER 4 — ASSETS, COSMETICS & CONTENT (SAFE)

This is where your earlier ideas shine.

🔟 Asset Registry System

Before Hytale, design how assets are managed.

Asset manifests

Hashing

Versioning

Dependency graph

Temporary vs persistent assets

CDN-ready structure

This supports:

Skins

Accessories

UI packs

Sound packs

1️⃣1️⃣ Cosmetic Authorization Layer

Very important legally.

Server-approved cosmetics only

Profile-bound cosmetics

Session-scoped cosmetics

Local-only cosmetics

Server override rules

This lets you:

Upload cosmetics via Yellow Tail

Enforce rules via Pond

Avoid cheating accusations

1️⃣2️⃣ Custom Content Designers (Offline)

No Hytale needed.

Skin editor

Accessory editor

Asset pack builder

Metadata editor

Validation tools

These output server-compatible asset packs later.

🌐 LAYER 5 — YELLOW TAIL ↔ POND COMMUNICATION

Design the protocol now.

1️⃣3️⃣ Control Protocol (Local)

IPC or localhost HTTP.

Start server

Stop server

Query status

Push config

Push assets

Receive metrics

Abstract it so later it works remotely too.

1️⃣4️⃣ Capability Advertisement

Server tells launcher what it supports.

Example:

supports:
- pond.performance
- pond.cosmetics
- pond.assets.hotload


This future-proofs everything.

🧠 LAYER 6 — UX & DEV EXPERIENCE

This is how you win adoption.

1️⃣5️⃣ Mod Library & Marketplace (Offline First)

Before CurseForge integration.

Local mod catalog

Version manager

Conflict detection

Enable/disable UI

Dependency warnings

Later → hook CurseForge or official repo.

1️⃣6️⃣ Diagnostics & Debug Tools

Free tier feature, btw.

Live RAM graph

Tick rate estimate

Plugin CPU usage

Error summaries

Auto-suggestions

This becomes your OptiFine moment.

💰 LAYER 7 — PREMIUM FEATURES (DESIGNED, NOT LOCKED)

You can design monetization now, enable later.

Free

Core launcher

Pond base

Local server integration

Basic performance presets

Mod management

Cosmetics (local/server-approved)

Premium Launcher (e.g. $0.99/month)

Advanced diagnostics

Smart JVM tuning

Profile sync

Experimental performance flags

Early access features

Premium Pond (e.g. $1.99/year)

Advanced tick optimizations

Plugin CPU budgets

Hot-reload safety nets

Priority task scheduling

Server analytics

No pay-to-win. All infra.

⏳ WHAT YOU CANNOT DO YET (AND SHOULDN’T)

Be explicit about this so you don’t waste time.

❌ Hook Hytale internals
❌ Assume tick methods
❌ Depend on server API names
❌ Client injection
❌ Rendering hacks

All of that comes after the jar.

🧠 WHY THIS WORKS

When hytaleserver.jar drops:

You do NOT rewrite everything.

You:

write adapters

bind events

map lifecycle

bridge APIs

Everything else already exists.
