You are an expert systems engineer, Rust developer, and desktop application architect.

You are building a native desktop launcher and orchestration platform, NOT a website and NOT a browser-based app.

This project must be future-proof, legally safe, high-performance, and game-agnostic.

🚫 ABSOLUTE HARD RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)

DO NOT build a web application

DO NOT rely on browser-based rendering

DO NOT use Electron

DO NOT embed Chromium

DO NOT assume any game APIs

DO NOT assume any mod loader APIs

DO NOT inject into game memory

DO NOT patch binaries

DO NOT hook rendering or input

DO NOT override official mod systems

The game is treated as a black-box executable.

🎯 PROJECT GOAL

Build Yellow Tale, a high-performance native launcher and orchestration layer that sits above an officially-moddable game.

Yellow Tale does NOT replace modding.
It enhances orchestration, performance preparation, caching, diagnostics, and UX.

Think:

Steam + Lunar Client + Paper-style philosophy
But without touching game internals.

🧱 REQUIRED TECH STACK
Backend (MANDATORY)

Language: Rust

Role: ALL system logic, performance tooling, file IO, networking, diagnostics

Frontend (MANDATORY)

Language: TypeScript

Framework: Tauri UI (React or Svelte acceptable)

Role: UI ONLY (no system logic)

IPC

JSON-based IPC using Tauri commands

Strictly versioned schemas

Config

TOML files

Versioned & migratable

⚙️ CORE SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT
1️⃣ Game Launcher (Generic)

User selects executable

Store path per profile

Launch process with:

env vars

working dir

args

Track PID

Detect crashes & exits

Clean shutdown handling

NO game-specific assumptions.

2️⃣ Profile System

Multiple user profiles

Each profile contains:

executable path

enabled mods

performance preferences

session preferences

Profiles stored as versioned TOML

Migration support for future schema changes

3️⃣ Mod Orchestration (NOT a loader)

Treat mods as opaque packages

Support:

install

remove

enable / disable

version pinning

Dependency graph resolution (generic)

Per-profile mod sets

Compatible with official mod systems without replacing them

4️⃣ Smart Cache System

Content-addressed storage (hash-based)

Deduplication across profiles

Background cache warming

Integrity verification

LRU eviction strategy

5️⃣ Performance Preparation (LEGAL & SAFE)

Implement ONLY pre-launch optimisations:

Process priority tuning

CPU core affinity

RAM cleanup before launch

Disk IO warm-up

Optional background task suppression

⚠️ NO runtime injection
⚠️ NO hooking
⚠️ NO cheating behavior

6️⃣ Diagnostics (Read-Only)

CPU usage

GPU usage

RAM usage

Disk IO

Frame-time variance (if observable externally)

Exportable logs

Expose all metrics via IPC.

7️⃣ Session Orchestration (Not a VPN)

Session broker client

Invite code generation

Session lifecycle tracking

Abstracted P2P attempt layer

Relay interface (stub, no infra assumptions)

This is connection orchestration, NOT tunneling.

8️⃣ IPC API

Strict JSON schema

Versioned commands

Error-first responses

UI communicates ONLY via IPC

No filesystem access from UI

9️⃣ UI REQUIREMENTS

Native desktop UI (Tauri)

Pages:

Play

Profiles

Mods

Performance

Diagnostics

Sessions

Settings

UI is a control panel, NOT a renderer

No web-only APIs

🧪 ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS

Clear module boundaries

Strong documentation

Comments explaining WHY, not just WHAT

Designed for future game API integration

No hardcoded assumptions

📦 DELIVERABLES

Fully compiling Rust backend

Working Tauri UI

IPC contract documented

Default configs

README explaining architecture decisions

🧠 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (IMPORTANT)

This project must survive:

game updates

mod loader changes

engine rewrites

legal scrutiny

If a feature risks legality, stability, or long-term survival:
DO NOT IMPLEMENT IT

Final Instruction

Build this as if:

the game already supports mods

the game APIs are unknown

the launcher must last years

performance and UX are the value
